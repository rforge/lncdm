Description: The package can get the methylation matrix and identify the differential methylation sites,elements or the regions who are in the elements of lncRNA etc. This package gets a matrix of methylation values of the samples. Then it can calculate the methylation values of elements. This package uses linear and t test to identify the differential methylation or the sites,elements and regions that related with the phenotype.
